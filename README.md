# AST

@strumenta/ast supplies the infrastructure to build a custom, possibly mutable, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using TypeScript.

Tylasu is part of the [StarLasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu) set of libraries. The other libraries provide similar support in other languages.

Tylasu is integrated with ANTLR, specifically [antlr4ts](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4ts).

## Building

`yarn build` compiles the sources.

`yarn dist` compiles, tests and builds the npm package.
