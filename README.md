# AST

@strumenta/ast supplies the infrastructure to build a custom, possibly mutable, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using TypeScript.
It's inspired by [Kolasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/kolasu) and integrated with ANTLR, specifically antlr4ts.

## Building

`yarn build` compiles the sources.

`yarn dist` compiles, tests and builds the npm package.
