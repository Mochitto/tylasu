# Tylasu â€“ AST Library for TypeScript

Tylasu supplies the infrastructure to build a custom, possibly mutable, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using TypeScript.

Tylasu is part of the [StarLasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu) family of libraries. The other libraries provide
similar support in other languages.

Tylasu is integrated with ANTLR, specifically [antlr4ts](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4ts).
